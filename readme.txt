Removes the "suggestions" that some plugins insert in the plugin search inside of WordPress.

== Description ==

Removes the "suggestions" that some plugins insert in the plugin search inside of WordPress.

At the beginning of April 2019, some plugins have started to insert results in the plugin search of WordPress. This plugin helps you to hide these "suggestions". If you install and activate this plugin the WordPress plugin search inside of your WordPress will only show the organic results and no promoted ones.

The most popular plugins that add these "suggestions" are JetPack and WooCommerce.

* Version 7.1 of Jetpack added featured suggestions to plugin search results: “If a user searches for a plugin that has a feature that is already offered by Jetpack, the plugin will insert an artificial (and dismissible) search result into the first plugin card slot, identifying the corresponding Jetpack feature”.

* Version 3.6 of WooCommerce added “Marketplace Suggestions”: “contextual mentions of official extensions that may be relevant to a customer”.

> In the first version we hide the "suggestions" of Jetpack, WooCommerce and the [tinyhelp project](https://github.com/tinyhelp/tinyhelp) but we will add more as we notice them.

If you install a plugin that injects ads in the WordPress plugin search of your WordPress, please send it to us so that we can include it in the plugin. Please note that we can only hide these "suggestions" from plugins that have a filter to hide them. Just send us the plugin and we will have a look: [send us an email](https://apasionados.es/contacto/index.php?desde=wordpress-org-remove-suggestions-from-plugin-search-results).
